# Gas Canister Notification

An application that notifies the homeowner about the level of their gas canister.

As a way to prevent the app from dying due to the large data responses that the server tells the owner about the level of their gas canister, I added message queue (Kafka) and socket for real-time interactions.

The idea is that the project works in several residences at once, and Helps the owner of the same to have the best control of the condition of the gas cylinder

## Getting Started

For run, first open your bash and execute this command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
the command runs the zookeeper and kafka. After start:

```bash
python3 sms_server.py
python3 main.py
```

# Technology Stack

- [Flask]() - For make the apis.
- [Pytest]() - For unit testing.
- [Pylint]() - For validate the convention.
- [Kafka]() - For messaging.
- [SocketIO]() - For real time interactions.
- [Pre-commit]() - For identifying simple issues before submission to code review.

Other techs:
- [Docker]() - For containerization.


# Feactures

- [x] Make that the house publishe on queue the state of gas canister and notify per phone number to owner of the residence.
