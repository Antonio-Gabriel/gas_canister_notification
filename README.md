# Gas Canister Notification

An application that notify on the owner to some residence over the level of your gas canister.  

To avoid that the app have an error because several residences notify at once i added a message brocker 
and for notify on real time, socketIO, this is a test for try real time notify and queue, because we will
install in many houses the system. So we are monitoring several houses at once.

For the backend i used python that is a script language, i thought to use mysql but in the moment i don't know.
For messaging i used Kafka and socketIO for real time interactions per events.

## Getting Started

Run the docker script, install python env and install the packages on env of python. After etc.
